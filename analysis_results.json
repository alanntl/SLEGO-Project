Here are the key insights from the analysis:\n\n1. **Health Implications of Under-Fuelling**: The article highlights that under-fuelling—consuming insufficient energy to meet the demands of training and daily life—is a prevalent issue among athletes. This can lead to severe health issues like irregular menstrual cycles, compromised bone health, iron deficiency, poor immune function, and gastrointestinal symptoms. These symptoms are associated with a condition known as Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S).\n\n2. **Challenges in Nutrition**: Athletes, particularly those in weight-based sports like boxing, face unique challenges in managing their diet. Maintaining a specific weight class often leads to restrictive eating patterns, which can harm physical and mental health. The emphasis is on the importance of professional guidance from sports dieticians to manage these challenges effectively.\n\n3. **Need for Education and Access**: The article stresses the need for better nutritional education for athletes at all levels, especially sub-elite and younger athletes who may not have regular access to sports dieticians. Proper education can significantly enhance athletic performance and overall well-being by ensuring athletes consume a balanced diet rich in carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and essential micronutrients.\n\n4. **Body Image and Mental Health**: There is a discussion on the pressures athletes face to maintain certain body images, which can negatively impact their mental health. This is particularly relevant in sports with aesthetic or weight-class components, where there is a tendency to develop an unhealthy relationship with food.\n\n5. **Personal Accounts and Expert Opinions**: The article includes personal experiences from athletes like Tiana Echegaray, Vanessa Panousis, and Quincy Dodd, who have faced challenges related to under-fuelling and have benefited from nutritional guidance. It also features expert insights from sports dietician Holly Edstein, who emphasizes the importance of individualized nutrition plans.\n\n6. **Broader Context**: The article is part of a broader range of topics covered by ABC News, which includes politics, business, science, and lifestyle, indicating the diverse content available from the media outlet.\n\nOverall, the article underscores the critical importance of proper nutrition in sports to prevent health issues and enhance athletic performance. It advocates for informed dietary practices and professional guidance to navigate the complex nutritional needs of athletes.",
